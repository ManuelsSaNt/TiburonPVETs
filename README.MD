# Punto De Venta De **El Tiburon Burger** 

## made with **ELECTRON JS**

``` js
class Author{
  this.auithor1 = "ManuelsSaNt"l
}
class ontributors{
  this.contrib1 = "JesusRojoP"
}
```

So, my family have`s a Burger restaurant and they need a "sell point" or desktop app to take 
orders and calculate the total price of a order, so i make one version on python with PySide6 but 
the compatibility with thermal printers are disguisting, so i say, fuc* bro im a web developer
and NodeJs exist so, Electron!!! ahahaha, and i make this electron-app that uses electron-pos-printer
to use my thermal printer and run good.

Electron its a bit confusing at the start but is a great framework with much to learn so

you can download the code or send me a DM to try to help you if you needed.

tanhks for reed this!!!
